                <br> At first, since there is a login page, it was about SQL injection and tried some combinations. But found nothing. Then started to play with url. If we delete the "auth" from url like ".......ctf.hacker101.com?page=admin.inc", we can bypass authentication and can access to admin page. The flag was at bottom of this page.
