<b>1st Flag</b>: When we look to source code, the image url's are like that: "fetch?id=1". I thought maybe i can find another things if change id. 
         For this I tried numbers 1 to 100 but i couldn't find anything. So i look to hints. It says: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46759694/193409474-ede15a75-fbcc-4f2d-8ded-d717ce8c2c85.png)
         <br> So i looked to uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker github repo and found that the main module is called "main.py". Since the hint mentions something about "the state of the union",
         i tried this with union sql injection: <br> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46759694/193409657-5a314ea5-59b6-4165-a751-5698f5888fd3.png)
