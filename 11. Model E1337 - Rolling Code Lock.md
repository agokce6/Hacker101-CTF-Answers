<b>1st Flag</b>: First, i tried some codes with the hope of finding something or some pattern. But i failed.
Then i looked to hint:"Hidden functionality is good functionality". Maybe this is about sub-directories. So i scan sub directories with Burp Intruder.
I used <a href="https://github.com/1N3/IntruderPayloads/blob/master/FuzzLists/dirbuster-top1000.txt">this payload</a> to scan. And found website has /admin page:

<br> In admin page's source code, there is something interesting:

<br> So i went to /get-config and looked to source code again

<br> If there is "get-config", there is also "set-config"? But it needs parameter to set. If we find this parameter, we can try to make XXE attack. To find parameter, i used
Burp Intruder again and found the parameter is calloed "data". Now, we can perform XXE attack with this payload

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE xxe[<!ENTITY writer SYSTEM "/etc/passwd">]>
<config>
  <location>&writer;</location>
</config>
```
