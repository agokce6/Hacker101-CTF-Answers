# Encrypted Pastebin

At the main page, we see that there is form which has two inputs: title and body. When the form is posted, title and body are encrypted and send to the "post" parameter in query. For example, https://-----.ctf.hacker101.com/?post=h7lx7F68Eh3TAMAN-dC0RJoUwS9SY.........JS7gg98L!P93QWjPaXiwC-g97evF9tu8dw!Q~~ .If we go to this link, server decrypts hash and displays as a plain text.

First thing i thought is adding random letter to hash. So, i got the first FLAG. And we also learn that block size is 16.

For second flag, i look to hint. it says "_Don't think about this in terms of an attack against encryption; all you care about is XOR_". So i was looking for something about padding. To solve padding and decrypt the hash ,we can use automating tool called <a href="https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/PadBuster">PadBuster</a>. Example use of PadBuster is given below:

We found that BlockSize is 16 and "_-encoding 0_" for base64 encoding.

After quiet time of running, we crack the hash and find the flag.

Note: I think, after found flag decryption is failed and rest of hash remain encrypted. It should also display title and body as flag.
